GitHub updates/commits + Terminal commands
pwd : pathway to current directory
ls : shows folders + files in current directory
cd (folder) : changes directory to folder within former directory
cd (pathway) : changes directory to directory addressed by pathway

git add .
git status
    allows to see uncommited changes
git commit -m 'message'
git push

    note : used git push -u origin -all instead of git push --set-upstream origin master
    to create pull request for 'master' : https://github.com/Ploenypp/PPI_L3/pull/new/master

CN
- choose overall highest CN score (bco) instead of best edge for each node (bcn)
    - in theory, bcn favors the creation of edges from the node of the lowest value (condition not explicity written/implemented)
    - result : creation high-degree nodes that could impact future predictions based on previous prediction

EVALUATION (DON'T DO UNTIL THAT EACH METHOD'S CODE WORKS)

>>> ???
- find precise criteria for link removal
- find specified structure for network

CN RA AA
    in order of broadness to specific 
    CN > RA > AA 

    in order of inclusion
    AA < RA < CN

    incorrect predictions most of the time, except sometimes 1 correct prediction (most likely chance?)
