QUESTIONS
- Common Neighbors algorithm
- "proteins of multiple shared partners, i.e. those connected by paths of lenth two..."
    proteins that share multiple partners
    proteins shared by multiple other proteins?
- co-complex membership annotations
- data class? (4, humans)
- Monte Carlo computation cross-validation >>> multiple random dataset splits -> training + validation data
- doesn't look at protein properties?

POI+C
- TCP : neighborhood-based similarity
    "hypothesis that protein pairs with similar interaction partners should interact fails for most protein pairs"
    "The larger the Jaccard similarity between two proteins, the lower the chance that tey interact with each other."
- L3 : "identify candidates that are smiliar to the known partners of a node"
    "proteins linked by multiple pahts of the length [3] ... are more likely to have a direct link"
- need for normalization : high-degree nodes --> biased predictions
- Testing (Monte Carlo comutation cross-validation)
    network -> training PPIs set + test dataset
    50% = input, predict remaining 50%
- Preferential Attachement principle : link "sticky" proteins, link score = product of degrees

BIO RESEARCH
- biological principles governing PPIs >>> https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.93.1.13
- co-localization + co-expression profiles
    >>> co-localization
            co-occurrence (spatial overlap) + correlation (codistriubte in proportion to one another)
    >>> co-expression
            presence of multiple proteins
- structural and gene duplication arguments? (to justify path length 3) 
    >>> structural = complementarity
    >>> gene duplication = gene not subject to selective pressure (genetic redundancy)
- "sticky" proteins
    >>> surface hydrophobic interactions (misfolded)

TESTING METHODS
- Computational cross-validation
- Pairwise >>> all possible discrete input combinations have been tested
- High-throughput >>> assay + reaction observation
